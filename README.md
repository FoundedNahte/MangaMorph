## About

Mangatra is a CLI tool that aims to provide the ability to rapid translate manga.

It can function as a tool for translators as well as an end-to-end solution for hands-off translation.
 - Extract/Replace modes allows translators to extract text into JSONs for translation as well as replace text boxes with translated JSONs. 
 - Translation mode is the combination of extract and replace mode as well as translation from ct2sugoi to provide end-to-end translation. 

It uses YOLOv5 to identify text boxes, OpenCV for image manipuation, and libtesseract for OCR capabilities. Because of the use of YOLOv5 for text box detection, the application can also be generalized to other forms of text besides manga.
